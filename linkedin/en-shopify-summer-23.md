# How Shopify Summer '23 Updates Make Building Your Online Store Cost-Effective

Tags: More Features without Third-Party Apps, AI Automation for Content

Building an online sales business can be challenging, from identifying your target audience and understanding their buying habits to selecting the right platform to sell your products. With numerous platform options available, making the right choice that aligns with your needs is crucial.

The platform you choose not only impacts your current selling process but also affects your business for years to come. Opting for a platform that doesn't suit your requirements can disrupt potential customer interactions and sales processes. Some platforms offer user-friendly features, seamless payment integration, easy shipping, and inventory management.

Shopify is one of the platforms I highly recommend for entrepreneurs looking to sell their products online. It caters to the needs of businesses, prioritizing technology, offering customizable options, ensuring scalability, and providing developers with an integration-friendly environment.

With its latest update, Shopify Summer '23 introduces several changes that can help businesses save costs while selling products online. In my opinion, these updates can reduce expenses in the selling process and enhance sales strategies to boost revenue.

## Product Bundles App

Bundling is one effective strategy to boost sales. You can create product bundles with your best-selling or top-rated items, allowing customers to purchase multiple products together without repeating the same process (adding products to the wishlist/cart and deciding quantities).

Previously, the bundling feature was not available for free on Shopify, but several third-party apps offered this functionality for online stores. Now, with the latest update, the Product Bundles App is available for free on the Shopify App Marketplace.

## Subscriptions App

Similar to bundling, which makes it easier for customers to purchase products seamlessly, subscriptions also aid your customers in making routine purchases for essential products. With subscriptions, customers can set up recurring purchases based on their buying frequency, whether it's monthly or weekly.

Imagine selling products like skincare or cat food. Your customers wouldn't want to forget to purchase these essential items. In the hustle and bustle of daily life, forgetfulness is common. Therefore, offering subscriptions ensures that customers receive the products they need regularly and without any hassle.

## AI for Commerce

Many platforms now utilize AI as a tool to assist both customers and entrepreneurs in completing tasks quickly and with high quality. Shopify incorporates AI integration for tasks such as writing blog posts for your online store and generating product descriptions according to your preferencesâ€”all with just a few clicks and based on the topics you wish to emphasize.

In my opinion, if your current focus revolves around the products you sell, developing new products, or creating the best products, using AI can save time on writing copy, articles about product usage, and more. Even if you have a marketer on your team, AI streamlines their tasks by generating key selling points and promoting your products.

## Faster Store Load

From a technological and user experience perspective, having a fast-loading online store is crucial for attracting customers and potential buyers. A quick and seamless browsing experience encourages users to make purchases, explore products, and place orders without hesitation.

I once read an article about website loading speed and how it affects the number of visitors to the site. Although I might not fully grasp the technical details, I understand that having a fast-loading website is essential.

I imagine this aspect becomes even more critical when you have competitors. If their websites load faster than yours, potential customers may opt for them instead.

### Consclusion

The above points highlighted from the Shopify Summer Update '23 are incredibly beneficial for a business owner like you, aiming to sell your flagship products online. It enables you to invest in a platform that meets your current needs and remains relevant for years to come. Moreover, from a technological standpoint, it facilitates the scalability of your product sales.
