"My Shopify App Journey: Learnings and Discoveries"

**The Case: Solving B2B with Subscription feature**

Encountering B2B customers unable to purchase via subscription triggered my main case study. Added features like a popup banner maker and volume discounts spiced things up.

**The Development Adventure:**

Navigating the nuances of Shopify's documentation, which tends to evolve rapidly, was related to solving a puzzle. Anyone who's dabbled in app development knows the struggle of outdated or unclear documentation, but with Shopify, it was a mix of challenge and discovery.

Escaping the "tutorial hell," a phase where one might find themselves lost in endless tutorials without a clear way out, felt liberating. This marked a shift from dependency on generic YouTube tutorials to a more focused exploration of Shopify's official development documentation.

Although Shopify's dev docs occasionally demanded a bit more time for intricate problem-solving, they consistently acted as a reliable guide. In the realm of app development, where every line of code matters, having a trustworthy documentation source is nothing short of a lifesaver.

**Shopify Functions:**

Now, let's talk about a real game-changer – Shopify Functions. Imagine it as the superhero stepping in to replace the cape of the previous Shopify Scripts feature. In the world of app development, especially within the Shopify ecosystem, Functions emerged as the dynamic tool to execute complex functionalities.

Before Functions, dealing with Scripts had its limitations. It was like having a reliable bicycle for everyday commuting, but suddenly being handed the keys to a sports car. Shopify Functions provided a more flexible, scalable, and efficient way to handle various tasks within the app.

Whether it's manipulating data, customizing the checkout process, or dynamically altering product prices, Shopify Functions became the go-to mechanism. It wasn't just an upgrade; it was a paradigm shift in how developers approached certain challenges.

In essence, discovering Shopify Functions wasn't just a feature update; it was an evolution that elevated the entire development experience within the Shopify ecosystem. It's related to upgrading from using a single-function tool to having a Swiss Army knife at your disposal – versatile, powerful, and ready for any development scenario.

**Theme Extension: A UI Challenge**

As someone mostly immersed in UI work, creating a Theme Extension was a bit challenging. Shifting from building custom blocks or sections within a theme to doing it in the app project made the codebase look complex.

**Deployment**

The deployment process got smoother with various hosting options, from virtual machines to cloud hosting like Heroku or Fly.io. I went for Fly.io to explore its infrastructure, and it turned out to be speedy and responsive.

Apps feature that hosted on Shopify's infrastructure, like Theme Extensions, Shopify Functions, Admin Extensions, etc., seamlessly integrated, making the differences almost indistinguishable from native Shopify features.

**When to Build a Custom App:**

Choosing between a custom solution and a third-party app hinges on the unique needs of each project. It's related to deciding between off-the-rack clothing and tailor-made suits; both have their place, and the decision depends on the specific requirements.

There are instances when a pre-built, third-party app from the Shopify App Store covers all the bases. It's like finding the perfect tool for the job in a ready-made toolkit. These apps are tried, tested, and widely used, offering a convenient solution without the need for extensive customization.

However, in scenarios where subscription costs or revenue sharing become significant considerations, the choice of a custom-built app becomes more appealing.

The decision-making process involves a cost-benefit analysis. While third-party apps might be cost-effective and time-efficient, they often come with subscription fees or revenue-sharing models. On the other hand, a custom app requires a more significant upfront investment but offers long-term flexibility and potentially lower operational costs.

**Keep Learning, Still Exploring:**

Despite the journey, there's still much to learn about Shopify's infrastructure. It's a breeze, especially for companies not tech-centric or lacking in-house development teams.

From B2C to B2B, Shopify empowers companies to focus on what matters most: delivering top-notch services or developing the best products tailored to customer needs.

**Conclusion:**

Shopify app development brings its challenges and joys. Here's to continuous learning and exploring the vast possibilities within Shopify's infrastructure. Hoping my experience can inspire and bring positive insights to fellow developers.
